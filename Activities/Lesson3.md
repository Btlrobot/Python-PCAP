# Python Fundamentals: Lesson 3

In this module, we will continue to cover the fundamental building blocks of the Python programming language, namely:

1. [Functions and Methods](#1-functions-and-methods)
2. [Input and Output](#2-input-and-output)
3. [Formatting](#3-formatting)
4. [Conditional Statements](#4-conditional-statements)

## 1. Functions and Methods

### Activities:
1. Write a function that returns the sum of two numbers.
2. Create a method for a string object that returns the string reversed.
3. Define a function to check if a number is even or odd.

## 2. Input and Output

### Activities:
1. Write a program that asks the user for their name and age, and then prints a greeting message.
2. Create a program that takes two numbers as input and prints their sum.
3. Write a program that asks the user for a number and prints whether it is positive, negative, or zero.

## 3. Formatting

### Activities:
1. Write a program that asks the user for their name and age, and prints a formatted string saying how old they will be in 5 years.
2. Create a program that prints the first 10 Fibonacci numbers, each formatted to be 5 digits long.
3. Write a program that prints the area and circumference of a circle given its radius, formatted to 2 decimal places.

## 4. Conditional Statements

### Activities:
1. Write a program that checks if a number is divisible by both 2 and 3.
2. Create a program that takes a temperature as input and prints whether it's cold, warm, or hot (use your own temperature thresholds).
3. Write a program that takes a grade as input and prints the corresponding letter grade (A, B, C, D, F).
